Tip

The optional output arguments can be used to help you save memory for large calculations. If your arrays are large, complicated expressions can take longer than absolutely necessary due to the creation and (later) destruction of temporary calculation spaces. For example, the expression G = a * b + c is equivalent to t1 = A * B; G = T1 + C; del t1. It will be more quickly executed as G = A * B; add(G, C, G) which is the same as G = A * B; G += C.

# Return (x1 != x2) element-wise.

# equal(x1, x2, /[, out, where, casting, …])

# Return (x1 == x2) element-wise.

# Warning

# Do not use the Python keywords and and or to combine logical array expressions. These keywords will test the truth value of the entire array (not element-by-element as you might expect). Use the bitwise operators & and | instead.

# logical_and(x1, x2, /[, out, where, …])

# Compute the truth value of x1 AND x2 element-wise.

# logical_or(x1, x2, /[, out, where, casting, …])

# Compute the truth value of x1 OR x2 element-wise.

# Compute the truth value of x1 XOR x2, element-wise.

# logical_not(x, /[, out, where, casting, …])

# Compute the truth value of NOT x element-wise.

# Warning

# The bit-wise operators & and | are the proper way to perform element-by-element array comparisons. Be sure you understand the operator precedence: (a > 2) & (a < 5) is the proper syntax because a > 2 & a < 5 will result in an error due to the fact that 2 & a is evaluated first.

# maximum(x1, x2, /[, out, where, casting, …])

# Element-wise maximum of array elements.

# Tip

# The Python function max() will find the maximum over a one-dimensional array, but it will do so using a slower sequence interface. The reduce method of the maximum ufunc is much faster. Also, the max() method will not give answers you might expect for arrays with greater than one dimension. The reduce method of minimum also allows you to compute a total minimum over an array.

# minimum(x1, x2, /[, out, where, casting, …])

# Element-wise minimum of array elements.

# Warning

# the behavior of maximum(a, b) is different than that of max(a, b). As a ufunc, maximum(a, b) performs an element-by-element comparison of a and b and chooses each element of the result according to which element in the two arrays is larger. In contrast, max(a, b) treats the objects a and b as a whole, looks at the (total) truth value of a > b and uses it to return either a or b (as a whole). A similar difference exists between minimum(a, b) and min(a, b).

# fmax(x1, x2, /[, out, where, casting, …])

# Element-wise maximum of array elements.

# fmin(x1, x2, /[, out, where, casting, …])
